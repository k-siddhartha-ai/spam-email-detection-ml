# 📌 Project Overview

Spam emails are one of the most common cybersecurity threats, often containing phishing links, fake prizes, malicious attachments, or financial scams.

This project demonstrates how Machine Learning can automatically classify email messages into:

- 🚨 **Spam Email**
- ✅ **Not Spam Email**
- ⚠️ **Uncertain Email**

Instead of forcing an incorrect prediction, the application returns an **Uncertain** result whenever the model confidence falls within a predefined range.

The application is built using **Python**, **Scikit-Learn**, **Gradio**, and deployed on **Hugging Face Spaces** for real-time predictions.

## ⚠️ Uncertain Email Prediction

If the confidence falls within the predefined threshold, the application returns an **Uncertain** result instead of forcing an incorrect prediction.
